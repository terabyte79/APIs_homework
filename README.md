# APIs_homework

The purpose of this homework is to create a tool that helps members of a credit union enhance their financial health.

The first part will be a personal finance planner that will allow users to visualize their savings composed of investments in shares and cryptocurrencies to assess if they have enough money as an emergency fund.

The second part will be a retirement planning tool that will use the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio composed of stocks and bonds. It will then run Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years, 10 years, and 5 years. We will use the Monte Carlo data to calculate the expected portfolio returns given a specific initial investment amount.

For Part 1 of this homework, the following assumptions are being made:

    The average household income for each member of the credit union is $12,000.
    Every union member has a savings portfolio composed of cryptocurrencies, stocks, and bonds.
    Crypto assets: 1.2 BTC and 5.3 ETH.
    Shares in stocks and bonds: 50 SPY (stocks) and 200 AGG (bonds).

For Part 2 of this homework:

A 30-year analysis is conducted, and a summary is generated based on an initial investment of $20,000.00 and $30,000.00 respectively.
Furthermore, a 10-year and 5-year simulation is conducted using an initial investment of $35,000.00.
